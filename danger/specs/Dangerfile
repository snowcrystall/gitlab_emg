NO_NEW_SPEC_MESSAGE = <<~MSG
You've made some app changes, but didn't add any tests.
That's OK as long as you're refactoring existing code,
but please consider adding any of the %<labels>s labels.

EE_CHANGE_WITH_FOSS_SPEC_CHANGE_MESSAGE = <<~MSG
You've made some EE-specific changes, but only made changes to FOSS tests.
This could be a sign that you're testing an EE-specific behavior in a FOSS test.

Please make sure the spec files pass in AS-IF-FOSS mode either:

1. Locally with `FOSS_ONLY=1 bin/rspec -- %<spec_files>s`.
1. In the MR pipeline by verifying that the `rspec foss-impact` job has passed.
1. In the MR pipelines by including `RUN AS-IF-FOSS` in the MR title (you can do it with the ``/title %<mr_title>s [RUN AS-IF-FOSS]`` quick action) and start a new MR pipeline.

CONTROLLER_SPEC_DEPRECATION_MESSAGE = <<~MSG
Do not add new controller specs. We are moving from controller specs to
request specs (and/or feature specs). Please add request specs under
`/spec/requests` and/or `/ee/spec/requests` instead.

See https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5076 for information.
