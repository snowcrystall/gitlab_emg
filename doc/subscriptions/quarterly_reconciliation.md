# The quarterly subscription reconciliation process

GitLab reviews your seat usage every quarter and sends you an invoice for
any overages.

Annual reviews, also known as the [annual true-up process](self_managed/index.md#users-over-license),
require you to pay the full annual subscription fee for users added anytime during the year. With quarterly
reviews, you only pay for the remaining period of your subscription term.

For example, if you add users in the third quarter of your subscription term, you only
pay 25% of what you would have paid previously. This results in substantial savings.

If it's not possible for you to participate in quarterly reconciliations, you can opt out of the
process by using a contract amendment. In that case, you default to the annual review.
