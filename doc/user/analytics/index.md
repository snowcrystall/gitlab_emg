# Analyze GitLab usage **(FREE)**

## Definitions

When we describe GitLab analytics, we use the following terms:

- **Cycle time:** The duration of only the execution work alone. Often displayed in combination with "lead time," which is longer. GitLab measures cycle time from issue first merge request creation to issue close. This approach underestimates lead time because merge request creation is always later than commit time. GitLab displays cycle time in [group-level Value Stream Analytics](../group/value_stream_analytics/index.md).
- **Deploys:** The total number of successful deployments to production in the given time frame (across all applicable projects). GitLab displays deploys in [group-level Value Stream Analytics](../group/value_stream_analytics/index.md) and [project-level Value Stream Analytics](value_stream_analytics.md).
- **DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment)** ["Four Keys"](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance):
  - **Speed/Velocity**

    - **Deployment frequency:** The relative frequency of successful deployments to production
      (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).
      This effectively measures how often you are delivering value to end users. A higher deployment
      frequency means you are able to get feedback and iterate more quickly in delivering
      improvements and features faster. GitLab measures this as the number of deployments to a
      [production environment](../../ci/environments/index.md#deployment-tier-of-environments) in
      the given time period.
      GitLab displays deployment frequency in [group-level Value Stream Analytics](../group/value_stream_analytics/index.md) and [project-level Value Stream Analytics](value_stream_analytics.md).
    - **Lead Time for Changes:** The time it takes for a commit to get into production. (1) GitLab
      measures this as the median duration between merge request merge and deployment to a
      [production environment](../../ci/environments/index.md#deployment-tier-of-environments) for
      all MRs deployed in the given time period. This measure under-estimates lead time because
      merge time is always later than commit time. The
      [standard definition](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fourkeys/blob/main/METRICS.md#lead-time-for-changes) uses median commit time.
      [An issue exists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328459) to start
      measuring from "issue first commit" as a better proxy, although still imperfect.

  - **Stability**
    - **Change Failure Rate:** The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.
      GitLab measures this as the number of [incidents](../../operations/incident_management/incidents.md)
      divided by the number of deployments to a
      [production environment](../../ci/environments/index.md#deployment-tier-of-environments) in
      the given time period. This assumes:

      - All incidents are related to a production environment.
      - Incidents and deployments have a strictly one-to-one relationship (meaning any incident is
        related to only one production deployment, and any production deployment is related to no
        more than one incident).

    - **Time to Restore Service:** How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in
      production. GitLab measures this as the average time required to close the
      [incidents](../../operations/incident_management/incidents.md) in the given time period.
      This assumes:

      - All incidents are related to a [production environment](../../ci/environments/index.md#deployment-tier-of-environments).
      - Incidents and deployments have a strictly one-to-one relationship (meaning any incident is related to only one production deployment, and any production deployment is related to no more than one incident).

- **Lead time:** The duration of your value stream, from start to finish. Different from [Lead time for changes](#lead-time-for-changes). Often displayed in combination with "cycle time," which is shorter. GitLab measures lead time from issue creation to issue close. GitLab displays lead time in [group-level Value Stream Analytics](../group/value_stream_analytics/index.md).
- **MTTC (Mean Time to Change):** The average duration between idea and delivery. GitLab measures MTTC from issue creation to the issue's latest related merge request's deployment to production.
- **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect):** The average duration that a bug goes undetected in production. GitLab measures MTTD from deployment of bug to issue creation.
- **MTTM (Mean Time To Merge):** The average lifespan of a merge request. GitLab measures MTTM from merge request creation to merge request merge (and closed/un-merged merge requests are excluded). For more information, see [Merge Request Analytics](merge_request_analytics.md).
- **MTTR (Mean Time to Recover/Repair/Resolution/Resolve/Restore):** The average duration that a bug is not fixed in production. GitLab measures MTTR from deployment of bug to deployment of fix.
- **Throughput:** The number of issues closed or merge requests merged (not closed) in some period of time. Often measured per sprint. GitLab displays merge request throughput in [Merge Request Analytics](merge_request_analytics.md).
- **Value Stream:** The entire work process that is followed to deliver value to customers. For example, the [DevOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/) is a value stream that starts with "plan" and ends with "monitor". GitLab helps you track your value stream using [Value Stream Analytics](value_stream_analytics.md).
- **Velocity:** The total issue burden completed in some period of time. The burden is usually measured in points or weight, often per sprint. For example, your velocity may be "30 points per sprint". GitLab measures velocity as the total points/weight of issues closed in a given period of time.

### Lead time for changes

"Lead Time for Changes" differs from ordinary "Lead Time" because it "focuses on measuring only the time to deliver a feature once it has been developed", as described in ([Measuring DevOps Performance](https://devops.com/measuring-devops-performance/)).

## Instance-level analytics

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12077) in GitLab 12.2.

Instance-level analytics make it possible to aggregate analytics across
GitLab, so that users can view information across multiple projects and groups
in one place.

[Learn more about instance-level analytics](../admin_area/analytics/index.md).
