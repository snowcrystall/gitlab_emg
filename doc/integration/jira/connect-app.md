# GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app **(FREE)**

NOTE:
Only Jira users with administrator level access are able to install or configure
the GitLab app for Jira Cloud.

## GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app **(FREE SAAS)**

You can integrate GitLab.com and Jira Cloud using the
[GitLab.com for Jira Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud)
app in the Atlassian Marketplace. The user configuring GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app must have
[Maintainer](../../user/permissions.md) permissions in the GitLab.com namespace.

This integration method supports [smart commits](dvcs.md#smart-commits).

This method is recommended when using GitLab.com and Jira Cloud because data is
synchronized in real-time. The DVCS connector updates data only once per hour.
If you are not using both of these environments, use the [Jira DVCS Connector](dvcs.md) method or
[steps to install GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app for self-managed instances](#install-the-gitlabcom-for-jira-cloud-app-for-self-managed-instances).

For a walkthrough of the integration with GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app, watch
[Configure GitLab.com Jira Could Integration using Marketplace App](https://youtu.be/SwR-g1s1zTo) on YouTube.

1. Go to **Jira Settings > Apps > Find new apps**, then search for GitLab.
1. Click **GitLab.com for Jira Cloud**, then click **Get it now**, or go to the
   [App in the marketplace directly](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud).

1. If not already signed in to GitLab.com, you must sign in as a user with
   [Maintainer](../../user/permissions.md) permissions to add namespaces.

   ![Sign in to GitLab.com in GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app](img/jira_dev_panel_setup_com_3_v13_9.png)
1. Select **Add namespace** to open the list of available namespaces.

1. Identify the namespace you want to link, and select **Link**. Only Jira site
   administrators are permitted to add or remove namespaces for an installation.

NOTE:
The GitLab.com user only needs access when adding a new namespace. For syncing with
Jira, we do not depend on the user's token.

After a namespace is added:

- All future commits, branches, and merge requests of all projects under that namespace
  are synced to Jira.
- From GitLab 13.8, past merge request data is synced to Jira.

Support for syncing past branch and commit data is tracked [in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/263240).

## Install the GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app for self-managed instances **(FREE SELF)**

If your GitLab instance is self-managed, you must follow some
extra steps to install the GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app.

Each Jira Cloud application must be installed from a single location. Jira fetches
a [manifest file](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/connect-app-descriptor/)
from the location you provide. The manifest file describes the application to the system. To support
self-managed GitLab instances with Jira Cloud, you can either:

- [Install the application manually](#install-the-application-manually).
- [Create a Marketplace listing](#create-a-marketplace-listing).

### Install the application manually **(FREE SELF)**

You can configure your Atlassian Cloud instance to allow you to install applications
from outside the Marketplace, which allows you to install the application:

1. Sign in to your Jira instance as a user with administrator permissions.
1. Place your Jira instance into
   [development mode](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-2--enable-development-mode).
1. Sign in to your GitLab application as a user with [Administrator](../../user/permissions.md) permissions.
1. Install the GitLab application from your self-managed GitLab instance, as
   described in the [Atlassian developer guides](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-3--install-and-test-your-app):
   1. In your Jira instance, go to **Apps > Manage Apps** and click **Upload app**:

      ![Image showing button labeled "upload app"](img/jira-upload-app_v13_11.png)

   1. For **App descriptor URL**, provide full URL to your manifest file, modifying this
      URL based on your instance configuration: `https://your.domain/your-path/-/jira_connect/app_descriptor.json`
   1. Click **Upload**, and Jira fetches the content of your `app_descriptor` file and installs
      it for you.
   1. If the upload is successful, Jira displays a modal panel: **Installed and ready to go!**
      Click **Get started** to configure the integration.

      ![Image showing success modal](img/jira-upload-app-success_v13_11.png)

1. Disable [development mode](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/getting-started-with-connect/#step-2--enable-development-mode) on your Jira instance.

The **GitLab.com for Jira Cloud** app now displays under **Manage apps**. You can also
click **Get started** to open the configuration page rendered from your GitLab instance.

NOTE:
If you make changes to the application descriptor, you must uninstall, then reinstall, the
application.

### Create a Marketplace listing **(FREE SELF)**

If you prefer to not use development mode on your Jira instance, you can create
your own Marketplace listing for your instance, which enables your application
to be installed from the Atlassian Marketplace.

For full instructions, review the Atlassian [guide to creating a marketplace listing](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/installing-cloud-apps/#creating-the-marketplace-listing). To create a
Marketplace listing, you must:

1. Register as a Marketplace vendor.
1. List your application, using the application descriptor URL.
   - Your manifest file is located at: `https://your.domain/your-path/-/jira_connect/app_descriptor.json`
   - GitLab recommends you list your application as `private`, because public
     applications can be viewed and installed by any user.
1. Generate test license tokens for your application.

Review the
[official Atlassian documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/installing-cloud-apps/#creating-the-marketplace-listing)
for details.

NOTE:
DVCS means distributed version control system.

## Troubleshooting GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app

The GitLab.com for Jira Cloud app uses an iframe to add namespaces on the settings page. Some browsers block cross-site cookies, which can lead to a message saying that the user needs to log in on GitLab.com even though the user is already logged in.

> "You need to sign in or sign up before continuing."

In this case, use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), or enable cross-site cookies in your browser.
